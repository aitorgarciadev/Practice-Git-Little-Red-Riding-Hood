                        <img src="/assets/caperucita.jpeg" alt="little red riding hood" class="mt-5 img-story">
                        <p class="mt-5">Once upon a time, in a quiet village surrounded by deep, dark forests, there
                            lived a cheerful
                            young girl named Little
                            Red Riding Hood. She earned her name from the bright red cloak her grandmother had made for
                            her. Little Red Riding Hood
                            was loved by everyone who knew her, especially her grandmother, who lived on the other side
                            of the forest.</p>
                        <h2 class="mt-5">Chapter 2: A Special Task</h2>
                        <img src="/assets/caperucitarojaMadre.jpeg" alt="little red riding hood" class="mt-5 img-story">
                        <p class="mt-5">One sunny morning, Little Red Riding Hood's mother called her into the kitchen.
                            "Your grandmother is not feeling well,"
                            she said, handing her a basket filled with fresh bread, butter, and sweet treats. "Take this
                            basket to her, but
                            remember, stay on the path and do not talk to strangers." Little Red Riding Hood promised to
                            follow her mother's advice
                            and set off for her grandmother's house.
                        <h2 class="mt-5">Chapter 3: Into the Woods</h2>
                        <img src="/assets/caperucitarojaBosque.jpeg" alt="little red riding hood"
                            class="mt-5 img-story">
                        <p class="mt-5">As Little Red Riding Hood ventured deeper into the forest, she admired the
                            vibrant flowers and listened to the birds
                            singing. Suddenly, a large wolf appeared from behind a tree. "Good morning, Little Red
                            Riding Hood," said the wolf,
                            trying to hide his hunger behind a friendly smile. "Where are you going on this fine day?"

                            Little Red Riding Hood, forgetting her mother's warning, replied, "I am going to visit my
                            grandmother who lives at the
                            end of this path."
                        <h2 class="mt-5">Chapter 4: A Wicked Plan </h2>
                        <img src="/assets/caperucitaWolf.jpeg" alt="little red riding hood" class="mt-5 img-story">
                        <p class="mt-5">The wolf's eyes gleamed with cunning. "What a lovely idea," he said. "But why
                            not bring her some flowers too? There are
                            some beautiful ones just off the path." Little Red Riding Hood, charmed by the wolf's
                            suggestion, wandered into the
                            woods to pick flowers. The wolf, meanwhile, hurried to the grandmother's house with a
                            devious plan in mind.
                        <h2 class="mt-5">Chapter 5: The Grandmother's House </h2>
                        <img src="/assets/casaAbuela.jpeg" alt="little red riding hood" class="mt-5 img-story">
                        <p class="mt-5">The wolf arrived at the grandmother's house and knocked on the door. "Who is
                            it?" called the grandmother. "It's me,
                            Little Red Riding Hood," replied the wolf, disguising his voice. The kind grandmother,
                            thinking it was her beloved
                            granddaughter, unlocked the door. The wolf leapt inside and gobbled her up in a single bite.
                            Then he put on her clothes
                            and climbed into bed, waiting for Little Red Riding Hood.
                        <h2 class="mt-5">Chapter 6: The Big Bad Wolf </h2>
                        <img src="/assets/loboAbuela.jpeg" alt="little red riding hood" class="mt-5 img-story">
                        <p class="mt-5">Little Red Riding Hood finally arrived at her grandmother's house, her basket
                            now filled with flowers as well. She
                            knocked on the door. "Who is it?" came the gruff voice of the wolf. "It's me, Little Red
                            Riding Hood," she answered.
                            "Come in, dear," the wolf called out. Little Red Riding Hood entered and approached the bed.

                            "Grandmother, what big ears you have!" she exclaimed. "All the better to hear you with, my
                            dear," replied the wolf.
                            "Grandmother, what big eyes you have!" "All the better to see you with, my dear."
                            "Grandmother, what big hands you
                            have!" "All the better to hug you with, my dear." "But Grandmother, what big teeth you
                            have!" "All the better to eat you
                            with!" roared the wolf, jumping out of the bed.
                        <h2 class="mt-5">Chapter 7: A Hero Appears </h2>
                        <img src="/assets/lenÌƒador.jpeg" alt="hero" class="mt-5 img-story">
                        <p class="mt-5">Just as the wolf was about to pounce on Little Red Riding Hood, a woodcutter who
                            had been passing by heard the
                            commotion. He burst into the house and saw the wolf ready to devour the little girl. With a
                            swift swing of his axe, he
                            struck the wolf down and rescued Little Red Riding Hood.
